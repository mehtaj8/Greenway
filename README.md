### Project Description

Everyone uses google maps, wayz and apple maps as a way of getting directions from one place to another, but owners of the vehicle may tell you that they never know how much it costs them to get there. When taking a trip to the beach with some friends, the driver of the vehicle always asks everyone for gas money and when it turns out to be too expensive it hurts everyones pockets. Have you ever wondered how much it costs to get to a destination before starting your journey? Well with "Greenway", the calcultion for fuel is done in real time. 

This idea takes the google maps API and uses that as the base of the app. The additional feature for this idea is the fuel calculation and database of cars. The user will be able to put in the specifications of their car (year, make, model, trim) or their gas mileage. When the user specifies a destination the app calculates not only the most fuel efficient route but the cost of driving that distance. The app does this calculation using gas price data from the nearest gas stations at the destination and elevation data of the route, taking into consideration how much gas will be used for uphill and downhill slopes.

The app can also automatically suggest gas stations to stop at for very long trips and even incorporate accommodations for hybrid/electric vehicles by adding supercharger locations to the map network.
