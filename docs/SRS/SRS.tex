\section{Introduction}

Navigation applications are commonly used applications while driving to get
directions from point A to B, but these applications never tell you how much it
costs you to get there or how much gas was used on the trip. When carpooling
with friends, the driver of the vehicle always asks everyone in the group for gas
money and often times these calculations are mere estimates that are not always
very accurate. People often wonder how much it costs to get to a destination
before starting your journey, having an application perform these cost and fuel
calculations based on real time gas pricing information ensures you save the
most money on your journey while minimizing gas usage to encourage a more
sustainable lifestyle. The introduction section focuses on the" Purpose of the Document", 
the "Scope of Requirements", the "Characteristics of the Intended Reader", 
and the "Organization of Document". 

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

The purpose of this document is to outline the overall description and target functionality
of the application to stakeholders. It will communicate, without any ambiguity, the system
requirements for Greenway and the different use cases and contexts of use. These design
aspects will be communicated using a combination of diagrams and written descriptions.
In addition, it will also serve as a reference for verifying correctness and validation of the
product during the testing phases.


\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

The intended readers characteristics include having knowledge in the following domains, 
the understanding of mapping software, the knowledge of how data is stored and will be used
in the context of the google maps API, which algorithms need to be used to calculate the most
fuel efficient route, the understanding of how terrain information will be used to alter car mileage
calculations, and the understanding of how information will be retrieved for all types of data being used.
The intended reader needs this knowledge as it is required to understand the rest of the SRS document;
this ensures the reader understands what the information is that is being conveyed and how the technology
is going to be used to put out the final product.

\subsection{Organization of Document}

The document is organized into sections with smaller subsection that will aid in conveying information.
The intention is that these sections will work together to provide a more informed understanding of the product.
The document is seperated into sections that include, "General System Description", "Specific System Description", "Requirements",
"Likely Changes", "Unlikely Changes", "Traceability Matrices and Graphs", "Development Plan", and the "Values of Auxiliary Constants".

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

The goal of Greenway is to create an application that allows users to provide car information and a destination, in return the application supplies the amount of money it will take for the user to reach that destination using the most fuel-efficient route calculated by the app. The application uses real-time gas price data, information on mileage data, and terrain data to calculate and provide the amount of money it would take to reach a destination for users who drive many different types of gas vehicles; this allows them to use this app in many ways, such as, figuring out which gym may provide the most bang for their buck based on distance from their location.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

The scope of the proposed software, Greenway, is a mapping software that not only 
gives fuel efficient directions to the intended destination but provides the user with fuel cost calculations.
The intention is to calculate fuel costs using gas price data, car mileage information and terrain information
to show how much money it will take to get to the intended destination using the most fuel efficient route.

\subsection{Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{Product Users}
The product user is anyone who can drive and hence will be using the product. The product users have the most influence on the requirements of the application and its overall development since the purpose of the application is help these users choose an cost effective eco-friendly route for a journey.

\subsubsection{Development Team}
The development team is the group of people who are developing the application. They are the software developers who are developing the application and hence are an important stakeholder.

\subsubsection{Teaching Staff/Instructors}
The teaching staff and instructors are also important stake holders as they will be directly interacting with our product and assessing its usability. They are similar to investors and are required to be shown updates and hold influence on the requirements of the application and its development.

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment and describes the user
characteristics.

\end{itemize}
\item Charging API Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Responsible for sending any Charging Station data required to a service needing it.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The users of this application are individuals who own gas powered vehicles and are looking for information on how much it will cost them in terms of fuel. This application will serve as a way of calculating the most fuel-efficient route taking into consideration elevation data, fuel mileage from an individuals car model, and the current gas prices. This users of app will have the ability to put in their car’s information, giving them all the data they require to make an informed decision on if the destination they chose is worth going to.

\newpage
\section{Behavior}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{DataFlowDiagram.png}
  \caption{Application Behavior from a Data Flow Diagram}
  \label{Fig_DataFlow} 
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The Data flow diagram is used to demonstrate how the app will behave when data is provided to it through the user requesting a route. More specifically the frontend will access the main process with the request and then it will calculate everything it needs to with multiple different processes it accesses. Namely the Fuel Process will give it data regarding the fuel prices, GPS will give all positioning data and elevation along with anything else the program displays, and car data will provide car efficiency data. All of which will be used to calculate the final route and price to display on the front end.

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

There are many skills needed to accomplish the task, these skills however need to be distributed amongst the team as it makes it easier to complete the goals that have been set to acquire a finished product. The domain specific knowledge required ranges from understanding APIs to collecting, storing, and using data. The team requires the knowledge of how to collect the different types of data required, gas price data, elevation data of a specified area, car catalog data that contains information about gas mileage, and google maps data for fuel efficient route calculations. The intention is to use this data as a collective to perform calculations which would allow the user to find the cost of travel from one destination to another in the simplest manner; for this, an understanding of how the Google Maps API works, how the application will be developed, how the interface will be designed, and how everything will work simultaneously to provide the user with the best experience. These tasks are split amongst the team.

There are many approaches to acquiring this knowledge; one approach is researching in the specific domain through forums and google searches. Another approach is getting hands on with the entity you would like to learn, this allows one to experience and interact with it, giving a greater understanding of how everything works.

\bigskip

\noindent Jash --- The approach for collecting gas price data will be through the research domain, this allows him to find information about the gas prices as well as learn how to collect and store them in a specific way. The same approach applies to the fuel calculations as understanding how its done and factoring in the elevation data is going to be used.

\bigskip

\noindent Priyansh --- The approach for collecting elevation data will be done through the research domain, this makes sure the data being collected is relevant to the information required to perform the fuel calculations. The same approach applies to the fuel calculations as understanding how its done and factoring in the elevation data is going to be used.

\bigskip

\noindent Utsharga --- The approach for collecting car catalog data will be done through the research domain, this allows him to collect all necessary data on all existing cars to be used in production. The same approach applies to the fuel calculations as understanding how its done and factoring in the elevation data is going to be used.

\bigskip

\noindent Sharjil --- The design of the user interface will be done through the hand-on domain, this allows him to interact with the product and test to see what works and what doesn’t. The calculations for the fuel-efficient route will be done through the research domain, this allows him to create and work on the algorithm required to perform the calculation.

\bigskip

\noindent Bilal --- The Google Maps API will require the hand-on domain to be used to explore how it works and how it will be used for the purposes of this application, this will allow him to learn what to do and how to use it for our needs. The calculations for the fuel-efficient route will be done through the research domain, this allows him to create and work on the algorithm required to perform the calculation.

\bigskip

\noindent Pranay --- The design of the user interface will be done through the hand-on domain, this allows him to interact with the product and test to see what works and what doesn’t. To get everything working together, he will have to look into the hand-on domain to be able to test and see how all the different parts will need to be integrated together to allow for the product to function as intended.
