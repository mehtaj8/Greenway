\section{Functional Requirements Evaluation}
Tests taken from V and V Plan section 5.1 are evaluated here and the corresponding section names are used as well.

\subsection{Start Screen}

Start screen covers functional requirements 1-5 from the SRS as all those requirements 
are related to the inputs and functionality that exists in the program before any 
processing or output is shown
		
\paragraph{Preliminary Information Tests} 

\begin{enumerate}

\item{preliminary-information-test-1\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: No input in the start screen
					
Input: Start Location
					
Desired output: Status Message stating if the start Location was accepted

Actual Output: No status message found

Result: Test case failed as the app failed to display a popup of location being validated.

Impact: The app will assume the use of valid start location as input as the core use of this app is 
to find the cost of trips not validate locations it is given.
					
\item{preliminary-information-test-2\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: No input in the start screen
					
Input: Location of the Destination
					
Output: Status Message stating if the Location was accepted

Desired output: Status Message stating if the destination location was accepted

Actual Output: No status message found

Result: Test case failed as the app failed to display a popup of the location being validated.

Impact: The app will assume the use of valid end locations as input as the core use of this app is 
to find the cost of trips not validate locations it is given.

\item{preliminary-information-test-3\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: No input in the start screen
					
Input: Car Details

Desired output: Status Message stating if the Car Information was accepted

Actual Output: No status message found

Result: Test case failed as the app failed to display a popup of the status message validating car details.

Impact: The app with its dropdown menus only allows the user to select valid cars and similarily only asks for 
mileage as alternative.

\item{preliminary-information-test-4\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: Accepted Car details in the start screen
					
Input: Car mileage/fuel economy information

Desired output: Status Message stating if the Car mileage/fuel economy information was accepted

Actual Output: No status message found

Result: Test case failed as the app failed to display a popup of the status message validating mileage information.

Impact: Small popup known as toast will be added to the app to indicate a valid/invalid value has been added to the mileage.

\item{preliminary-information-test-5\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: Accepted Car details in the start screen
					
Input: Car information

Desired output: Status Message stating if the Car information was updated

Actual Output: No status message found

Result: Test case failed as the app failed to display a popup of the status message stating if the Car information was updated successfully.

Impact: The popup does not need to exist as the app should require a full reset as a lot of different information needs to be 
updated to make this feature viable for the major goal of this app.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Map Interactions}

Map Interaction covers functional requirements 6-8 as these requirements 
are concerned with functionality related to the map on display.
		
\paragraph{Map Tests}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{map-test-1\\}

Impact: None
					
\item{map-test-2\\}

Control: Manual
					
Initial State: Start Screen finished
					
Input: None

Desired output: Map displaying all gas stations that it can possibly encounter along the route from a start to end destination

Actual Output: Found no gas stations along the route being displayed.

Result: Test case failed as the desired output was not found in the app.

Impact: The requirement that was used in the derivation process for this is not important anymore as the app functions on the basis that refueling 
is done at the start of the trip.
					
\item{map-test-3\\}

Control: Manual
					
Initial State: Start Screen finished
					
Input: None

Actual Output: Found no gas stations as such  along the route being displayed.

Result: Test case failed as the desired output was not found in the app.

Impact: Gas prices could not feasibly be found for all the gas stations as such the requirements used to derive this test case are not 
valid anymore.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Backend Processing}

Backend processing covers functional requirements 9-12 as these 
requirements are concerned with calculations and, external data collection and processing 
alike.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\subsection{Preliminary Information Tests}
To start with there will be some changes incoming to the SRS firstly FR-1 and FR-2 will be removed or modified due to 
preliminary-information-test-1 and 2. And FR-3 will be modified due to the results of test preliminary-information-test-3. 
The test preliminary-information-test-4 showed there is a need for small popup with the use of a toast ui component in the 
app and this will be added to the application. The test preliminary-information-test-5 showed that the SRS needs to be updated 
with removal or modification of FR-5 due to the changed priorities of the application.

\subsection{Map Interactions}
The test Mapmap-test-2 showed that the SRS needs to be changed for FR-7 as the refueling functionality has been modified from 
original concept of the application so this requirement will be changed or removed entirely. Similar idea for map-test-3 as the 
refueling functionality of the original concept has changed there is no need to show individual fuel prices in a certain area 
with the need of it being removed/changed.

\subsection{Backend Processing}
No changes to the backend from the testing.

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}
From test-ui-5 it can be seen due to the change in goals for the app accessibility for the visually impaired is infeasible so NFR-7 will 
be changed or removed. The test test-qol-1 it can be seen that instructions need to be added to the applications for making it simpler to 
install. The test test-pr-1 failed as the application we have is un optimized for performance optimization and as such the app will focus 
on reducing processing time and interactions with database to reduce calculation time. From the result of test-pr-4 it is that the app is 
unable to correctly respond to a lot of invalid inputs and since the focus of our app has changed to assuming correct inputs the SRS will 
be updated to modify or remove NFR11.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV? If there were differences, what changes required the modification in the plan? Why did these changes occur? Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future projects? If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the evidence that demonstrates the required quality? (It is expected that most teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)  
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item Utsharga: A lot more external testing was required compared to what we had planned. These changes had occured due to us lacking of insight. Through our user survey we verfied and validated our results and we plan to make changes according to that.
\item Bilal: The VnV plan was different from the VnV as the requirements implemented have changed for the implementation so the test results are 
different from expectations. A lot of changes occured due to infeasible implementation of certain core features and changes in focus for the app. 
All these changes are not possible to predicted before hand unless multiple small poc are made for each feature which is obviously not doable in 
the timeframe of this project.
\item Pranay: The testing we conducted for the VnV differed considerably from the original Verification and Validation Plan. Since creating our VnV plan nearly four months, the Greenway app has undergone several considerable changes with regards to the variety of features we included as well as minor changes to the core functionality of the app. Although the changes to the core functionality felt minor, we failed to meet many of the functional requirement tests outlined in our VnV Plan. These changes were hard to anticipate and it seems unlikely that we will be able to anticipate these changes in future projects. Some issues are simply impossible to predict until you have progressed further and garnered more insight. 
\item Priyansh: The VnV plan differed from the actual VnV process because the requirements that were implemented had been changed over the course of several months. This resulted in test results that were different from what was expected. Many changes had to be made due to the change in requirements for certain core features and a shift in focus for the application. Anticipating all of these changes beforehand was not feasible without creating multiple small prototypes for each feature, which was not possible within the project's timeframe.
