\section{Team Meeting Plan}
The team will meet once a week either Friday evening or Sunday afternoon to work 
on the development of Greenway. Each member will contribute equally in discussions 
centered around project design and development. The purpose of each meeting is to 
come together to make progress on the next milestone/deliverable for the project. 
Detailed meeting agenda points and to-do items will be specified before each meeting. 
A member of the team will take meeting minutes and record our discussion in our 
group Notion. Each meeting will end with a discussion of what needs to get completed 
before our next meeting.

\section{Team Communication Plan}
The team will communicate with one another primarily using Facebook messenger group 
chat. Issues regarding specifics within the source code or documentation will be 
raised on GitHub when necessary. Secondary documentation of our projects and 
conversations are recorded on the group Notion page. For urgent matters, all of 
our personal phone numbers and emails are also accessible.
