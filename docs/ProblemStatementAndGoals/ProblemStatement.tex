\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
Navigation applications are commonly used applications while driving to get directions 
from point A to B, but these applications never tell you how much it costs you 
to get there or how much gas was used on the trip. When carpooling with friends, 
the driver of the vehicle always asks everyone in the group for gas money and 
often times these calculations are mere estimates that are not always very 
accurate. People often wonder how much it costs to get to a destination before 
starting your journey, having an application perform these cost and fuel calculations 
based on real time gas pricing information ensures you save the most money on your 
journey while minimizing gas usage to encourage a more sustainable lifestyle.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
