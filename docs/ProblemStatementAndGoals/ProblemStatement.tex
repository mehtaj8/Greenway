\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
Navigation applications are commonly used applications while driving to get directions 
from point A to B, but these applications never tell you how much it costs you 
to get there or how much gas was used on the trip. When carpooling with friends, 
the driver of the vehicle always asks everyone in the group for gas money and 
often times these calculations are mere estimates that are not always very 
accurate. People often wonder how much it costs to get to a destination before 
starting your journey, having an application perform these cost and fuel calculations 
based on real time gas pricing information ensures you save the most money on your 
journey while minimizing gas usage to encourage a more sustainable lifestyle.

    \hline
    \textbf{Inputs} & \textbf{Outputs}\\ \hline
    Starting location & Most fuel efficient route\\ \hline
    Ending location & Cost of driving (from starting to ending location)\\ \hline
    Car specifications (year, make, model, trim) or fuel economy & Suggested stops at gas stations/supercharger locations based on real-time prices\\ \hline
    User estimate of how much fuel or distance worth of fuel is currently in the gas tank. & \\ \hline

\textbf{Goals} & \textbf{Importance}\\ \hline
The finished product is able to determine the fuel economy of any given car as input. & This is one of the fundamental functions which will help the product appeal to the stakeholders. The larger the database, the more it might be used.\\ \hline
The finished product is able to calculate the trip cost based on mileage and distance travelled, while factoring in elements like the terrain. & This will ensure trips costs are calculated as accurately as possible factoring in trip length, fluctuating gas prices, and elevation changes over the route.\\ \hline 
This will ensure trips costs are calculated as accurately as possible factoring in trip length, fluctuating gas prices, and elevation changes over the route. & This allows the product to be used reliable for long-term trips without need to regularly updated. Limiting the number of updates will also ensure product reliability and user familiarity.\\ \hline 
This allows the product to be used reliable for long-term trips without need to regularly updated. Limiting the number of updates will also ensure product reliability and user familiarity. & This will ensure the user gets gas prices in real time, hence cost of trip updates with changing prices.\\ \hline
This will ensure the user gets gas prices in real time, hence cost of trip updates with changing prices. & This allows the product to be robust and resistant to being outdated. \\ \hline
