\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}


The goal of Greenway is to create an application that allows users to provide car information
and a destination, in return the application supplies the amount of money it will take for
the user to reach that destination using the most fuel-efficient route calculated by the app.
The application uses real-time gas price data, information on mileage data, and terrain data
to calculate and provide the amount of money it would take to reach a destination for users
who drive many different types of gas vehicles; this allows them to use this app in many
ways, such as, figuring out which gym may provide the most bang for their buck based on
distance from their location.

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective of the document is to test the various subsystems identified in the system requirements and the systems design documents to ensure correctness and demonstrate adequate usability. 
Often times software may have
bugs that is experienced by the end-user. This document will try to mitigate those issues by
ensuring the underlying logic for the subsystems are performing as expected. This will be
done through a suite of Unit Tests to test the functional and non-functional requirements.
The code tested will be the underlying logic functions that interact with the database and
send information back to the client since the rest of the system is front-end UI aspects.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

The following project members are responsible for all procedures of the verification and validation processes including writing and executing tests:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Utsharga Rozario
    \item Jash Mehta
    \item Priyansh Shah
    \item Bilal Shaikh
    \item Sharjil Mohsin
    \item Pranay Kotian
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

The following plans indicate what our team intends to do for SRS verification:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Review by teammates:} This plan involves going through each SRS and verifying whether each SRS is still valid within our given scope.
    \item \textbf{Review by stakeholders:} This plan involves going through each SRS with our stakeholder and how they view them in perspective to your usage.
    \item \textbf{Task based inspection:} This plan involves going through each SRS as a task, generally done by a teammate or stakeholder.
    \item \textbf{Checklist:} This plan involves verifying if each SRS has been met through our previously set checklist in our SRS document.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The following plans indicate what our team intends to do for Design verification:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Review by teammates:} This plan involves going through the design of the project with our teammates through a high-fidelity prototype or a functional prototype, and verifying if the design is meets the expectation stated in the SRS.
    \item \textbf{Review by stakeholders:} This plan involves going through the design of the project with our stakeholders through a high-fidelity prototype or a functional prototype, and verifying if the design is meets the expectation stated in the SRS.
    \item \textbf{Task based inspection:} This plan involves going through each feature as a task in a high-fidelity prototype or a functional prototype, generally done by a teammate or stakeholder.
    \item \textbf{Checklist:} This plan involves verifying if each design requirements have been met through our previously set checklist in our SRS document.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}
The following plans indicate what our team intends to do for Implementation verification:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Code Inspection:} This will be used for the test plans in section \ref{PIT}.
    \item \textbf{Static Analysis:} This will be used for the test plans in section \ref{MI} and section \ref{BE}.
    \item \textbf{Non-functional Testing:} Non-functional Requirements test plans are written in details in section \ref{NFR}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
The following Automated Testing Tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cypress:} Cypress is an automated testing tool from front-end development and has ability to take screenshots and video recordings of tests, allows developers to do asynchronous testing, and has In-browser debugging environment. Hence will be used to perform front-end testing on React.
    \item \textbf{Mocha:} Mocha is one of the oldest and most well-known testing frameworks for Node.js and hence will be used for our project. It has also evolved with Node.js and the JavaScript language over the years, such as supporting callbacks, promises, and async/await which we intend to use in our back-end.
    \item \textbf{Mongo Orchestration:} Mongo Orchestration is an HTTP server providing a RESTful interface to MongoDB process management running on the same machine and will be used to test our MongoDB database.
\end{itemize}
The following Verification Tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{EsLint:} ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs and hence will used for linting our front-end (React) and back-end (Node.js).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

There are no available external data that can help validate the software. Hence, there are no plans for validation for now.

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

The areas of testing listed below are the following: Start screen, Map Interactions, 
Backend processing, Results Display. Start screen covers functional requirements 1-5 
from the SRS as all those requirements are related to the inputs and functionality that 
exists in the program before any processing or output is shown. Map Interaction covers 
functional requirements 6-8 as these requirements are concerned with functionality related 
to the map on display. Backend processing covers functional requirements 9-12 as these 
requirements are concerned with calculations and, external data collection and processing 
alike.

with a reference dataset with correct fuel consumption data.
					
\item{backend-test-4\\}

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item On a scale of 1 - 10, how aesthetically pleasing is the user interface?
  \item Does the user interface have a consistent graphical style throughout the system?
